##Design patterns
In this project we used..
##Creational design patterns such as:
###-Factory
###-Singleton A class of which only a single instance can exist

##Structural design patterns which is:
###-Flyweight:
A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
###-Dynamic Linkage:
 Allow a program, upon request, to load and use arbitrary classes that implement a known interface.
 
##Behavioral design patterns such as:
###-Snapshot:
Capture a snapshot of an object's state so that the object's state can be restored later. The object that initiates the capture or restoration of the state does not need to know anything about the state information. It only needs to know that the object whose state it is restoring or capturing implements a particular interface
###-Strategy
encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
###-State
Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
###-Iterator
sequentially access the elements of a collection
###-Observer 
To Notify Classes for any sudden changes
